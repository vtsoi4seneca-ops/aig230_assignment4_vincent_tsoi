    "## Word Embeddings: Learning Meaning from Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal of this lab:** learn how *continuous vector representations* (embeddings) are learned from data, and how they are used in practical NLP workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you should be able to:\n",
    "1. Explain **distributional semantics** (\"meaning from context\").\n",
    "2. Train word embeddings using **Word2Vec** and **FastText** (with Gensim).\n",
    "3. Use embeddings for **similarity search** and **analogy / vector algebra**.\n",
    "4. Visualize a word embedding space and interpret what you see.\n",
    "5. Explain why embeddings help with **sparsity** and **generalization** compared to n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry relevance (why you should care)\n",
    "Even in the era of transformers, embeddings remain widely used for:\n",
    "- **Semantic search** and query expansion  \n",
    "- **Similarity / recommendation** (nearest neighbors in vector space)  \n",
    "- **Clustering** and exploratory analysis  \n",
    "- Lightweight NLP systems where large models are too expensive"

    "1. Main limitation of one-hot vectors: One-hot vectors are high-dimensional and sparse (mostly zeros), which is memory-inefficient and computationally expensive. More importantly, they fail to capture semantic relationships between words—every word is equally distant from every other word in the vector space, so there's no way to represent similarity or meaning overlap.\n",
    "2. \"Meaning emerges from co-occurrence patterns\": This captures the distributional hypothesis—the idea that words with similar contexts (words they frequently appear near) tend to have similar meanings. For example, \"physician\" and \"doctor\" often appear with words like \"patient,\" \"hospital,\" and \"treatment,\" which allows us to infer they are semantically related even without a dictionary definition."
